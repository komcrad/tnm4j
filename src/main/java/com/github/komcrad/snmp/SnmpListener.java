/**
 * A component that listens for SNMP notifications (traps, informs) and
 * makes them available to registered handlers.
 * <p>
 * Conceptually, a listener represents a provider component that listens for
 * incoming SNMP notifications at the transport layer of the network.  Typically,
 * an implementation binds a socket to an IP address and port and receives all
 * incoming SNMP notifications received on that socket.
 * <p>
 * A listener maintains an ordered collection of handlers, based on a priority
 * specified when each handler is registered.  When an SNMP notification is
 * received, registered handlers are invoked in priority order.  When a handler
 * indicates that it handled the event (via the return value of
 * {@link SnmpNotificationHandler#handleNotification(SnmpNotificationEvent)}),
 * handlers of lower priority are not invoked.
 * <p>
 * The listener can be used to implement a strategy for handling different types
 * of notifications, where a given handler supports one notification type (or
 * perhaps a set of closely related types).  For each received notification,
 * the listener will ask each registered handler (in priority order) to handle
 * the notification, stopping with the first handler that claims to have done so.
