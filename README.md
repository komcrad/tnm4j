This repo has been repackaged to deploy a specific patch regarding snmpv3 to maven central so I could meet a deadline.
For public use; use [soulwing/tnm4j]("https://github.com/soulwing/tnm4j")

A simplified SNMP API for Java, inspired by Jürgen Schönwälder's Tnm
extension for Tcl.  

The original Tnm made it easy to write network management applications using
simple Tcl scripts.  Tnm4j attempts to bring this same simplicity to the
task of writing network management applications in Java or in Java-based
scripting languages such as Groovy.

Architecture
------------
Tnm4j provides a lightweight façade over an SNMP adapter and a MIB parser
adapter.  These adapters each implement a Tnm4j service provider interface to
adapt a third-party library for use with Tnm4j.  The JDK's [ServiceLoader](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html)
mechanism is used to locate adapters for SNMP and MIB parsing support.

The default SNMP adapter uses [Snmp4j](http://www.snmp4j.org) by Frank Fock and
Jochen Katz.  Snmp4j is an outstanding library providing comprehensive support
for SNMP communications in Java.

The default MIB adapter uses Per Cederberg's excellent [Mibble](http://www.mibble.org) MIB parser.

Other SNMP providers or MIB parsers could be easily adapted for use with
Tnm4j by implementing the necessary SPI.


Trivial Example
---------------

The following example illustrates just a few of the features of Tnm4j.  This
snippet retrieves and displays the name, description, and up time of an
SNMP-enabled network device.

```
MIB mib = MIBFactory.getInstance().newMib();
mib.load("RFC1213-MIB");

SnmpV2cContext snmp = SnmpFactory.getInstance().newSnmpV2cContext(mib);
snmp.setAddress("10.0.0.1");
snmp.setCommunity("public");

VarbindCollection varbinds = snmp.getNext("sysName", "sysDescr", "sysUpTime").get();
for (Varbind varbind : varbinds) {
  System.out.format("%s=%s\n", varbind.getName(), varbind.toString());
}
```

Notice how the MIB and SNMP context objects are designed to work together?
This is arguably the most salient concept of Tnm4j.  Tnm4j fully exploits
the MIB to make it easy for the developer to access management objects in
an SNMP agent.  The developer can use MIB object names (instead
of SNMP object identifiers) when getting or setting object values, reducing
the time and effort required to get the desired management information.

The syntax and textual convention details from the MIB are used when
converting object values to strings.  This is illustrated in the preceding
example -- converting a retrieved value to a string in the appropriate
format is as simple as calling `Varbind.toString()`.


Getting Started: Targets, Contexts, and Operations
--------------------------------------------------

In using Tnm4j, there are three fundamental objects you will use to interact
with SNMP agents: *targets*, *contexts*, and *operations*.

A *target* is a simple object that describes the relevant characteristics of a
remote agent necessary for communication.  A target implements either the
`SnmpV2cTarget` or `SnmpV3Target` interface, depending on whether the remote
agent supports the SNMPv2c or SNMPv3 protocol.  These interfaces describe
properties such as network address and security characteristics of the remote
agent.  Tnm4j provides simple concrete target implementations --
`SimpleSnmpV2cTarget` and  `SimpleSnmpV3Target` -- that your application can
construct and configure directly.  Alternatively, your domain model objects
representing network devices could easily implement these interfaces, allowing
your model objects to be used directly as targets.

A *context* provides the ability to invoke SNMP operations on a given target.
You create a context using `SnmpFactory` and providing the target to the
factory method:

```
import org.soulwing.snmp4j.*;

SimpleSnmpV2cTarget target = new SimpleSnmpV2cTarget();
target.setAddress("10.0.0.1");
target.setCommunity("public");

SnmpContext context = SnmpFactory.getInstance().newContext(target);
try {
  // perform some SNMP operations
}
finally {
  context.close();
}
```

As shown in the preceding snippet, a context must (eventually) be closed, in 
order to avoid a resource leak.  Contexts are, however, **lightweight objects** 
and it is quite reasonable to create and retain a context for as long as you 
need to continue communicating with the target SNMP agent.  Depending on the 
needs of your application, this could be as short as the time needed to perform 
a few SNMP operations, or perhaps for as long as the remote agent exists and 
your application continues running.  Tnm4j is used in applications that retain
thousands of context objects on the heap.

If you neglect to close a context, it will eventually be closed when your code
no longer holds any references to it -- the underlying implementation implements
`finalize` to close the context if necessary.  However, as it is difficult to
predict when a discarded context will be reclaimed by the JVM's garbage
collector, it is a best practice to close a context before you discard the last
reference to it.

### Performing SNMP Operations

Once you have a context for a given target, you can use the context to perform
SNMP operations on the targeted SNMP agent:

```
SnmpContext context = SnmpFactory.getInstance().newContext(target);
try {
  VarbindCollection result = context.get("1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0").get();
  System.out.println(result.get(0));
}
finally {
  context.close();
}
```

The preceding snippet uses the context to invoke a GET operation on the
remote agent and stores a reference to the retrieved variable bindings --
*varbinds* in SNMP speak.  The numeric object ID used here (in case you
didn't recognize it) is the SNMP `sysUpTime` object.  When invoking an
operation, we can request an arbitrary number of SNMP objects; the operation
methods include variants which take a variable number of arguments or a
`List`.

> If you're wondering why we're using numeric OIDs here instead of names,
> just hang on... we'll get there shortly!

In addition to the `get`, the context provides methods to support all of the 
fundamental SNMP operations: GET, GETNEXT, GETBULK, and SET.  Moreover, it 
provides methods to support easy and efficient SNMP table walks, which we'll 
cover later. See the [javadoc](http://soulwing.github.io/tnm4j/maven-site/apidocs)
for the full details.

You might have noticed there are quite a few *gets* in those two lines of code
inside of the *try* block.  The snippet is written in the idiomatic style
recommended for Tnm4j, which is lean on syntax, and hides a lot of the
underlying details. Let's break it down a little more to help you understand
what's going on.  We could rewrite the snippet a little more verbosely, like
this:

```
SnmpContext context = SnmpFactory.getInstance().newContext(target);
try {
  SnmpResponse<VarbindCollection> response = context.get("1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0");
  VarbindCollection result = response.get();
  Varbind sysUpTime = result.get(0);
  System.out.println(sysUpTime);
}
finally {
  context.close();
}
```

Now we can see that when we use `get` to perform a GET operation, the
return value is an `SnmpResponse`.  If you check out the the javadoc
[SnmpResponse](http://soulwing.github.io/tnm4j/maven-site/apidocs/org/soulwing/snmp/SnmpResponse.html) 
you'll see that it has a single method (`get`) that retrieves the result of the 
SNMP operation.  The response object is patterned after the JDK's `Future` 
object -- the `get` method will block until the result of the operation is 
available.  If the operation fails, the relevant exception will be thrown when 
you try to get the result from the response object.

Assuming that the operation succeeds, the result we retrieve from the response
object is a [VarbindCollection](http://soulwing.github.io/tnm4j/maven-site/apidocs).  This object 
is *not* a subtype of the JDK's `Collection` type.  However, it has an interface 
with methods that have familiar signatures supporting both list-like and map-like 
access to the varbinds in the collection.  In this example, we're using a 
list-like getter that takes an index -- since we requested only one varbind in the 
GET operation, there is exactly one varbind in the result (and it has index 0).

> In addition to the access methods provided on the `VarbindCollection`
> interface, you can use the `asList` or `asMap` methods to efficiently coerce
> the varbind collection to a JDK `List` or `Map`.  This feature is especially
> handy when using Tnm4j with JavaEE's expression language (EL) or in a
> scripting language such as Groovy, which provides a lot of sweet syntax sugar
> for lists and maps.

### Using MIBs and Named Objects

One of the major benefits of Tnm4j is that it fully integrates the textual
description of SNMP managed objects known as the Management Information Base or
MIB.  By loading one or more MIB module definitions, you can specify SNMP
objects by name when invoking operations and retrieving results.

In Tnm4j the `Mib` object is used to load MIB module definitions.  You create
a `Mib` using `MibFactory`.  When creating context objects you can specify the
MIB to be used by the context.  All contexts sharing the same MIB have access
to the MIB modules loaded into the MIB.

Let's rework our previous example, to make use of a MIB.

```
import org.soulwing.snmp4j.*;

Mib mib = MibFactory.getInstance().newMib();
mib.load("SNMPv2-MIB");

SimpleSnmpV2cTarget target = new SimpleSnmpV2cTarget();
target.setAddress("10.0.0.1");
target.setCommunity("public");

SnmpContext context = SnmpFactory.getInstance().newContext(target, mib);
try {
  VarbindCollection result = context.getNext("sysUpTime").get();
  System.out.println(result.get("sysUpTime"));
}
finally {
  context.close();
}
```

Note that not only do we ask for the *sysUpTime* object by name when invoking
the operation, we can also use the name to retrieve the value from the resulting
varbind collection.

If you're reading closely, you might have noticed that we used `getNext`
to invoke a GETNEXT operation -- in the previous example we used a GET
operation.  The reason for this change involves something fundamental about the
way management objects are represented by SNMP.

> #### A Brief Diversion on the topic of Object Indexes
>
> In SNMP, every managed object **type** has a unique object identifier.  For
> example, the standard MIB includes an interface table with an object named
> *ifDescr* that describes a network interface.  The unique identifier of the
> *ifDescr* object **type** is 1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.2. Similarly, the *sysUpTime*

> ```
> 
> So why did we call `getNext` instead of `get`?  In SNMP, the GETNEXT operation

>
> For example the **type** identifier for *sysUpTime* is 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3, which

### Setting Object Values

In addition to retrieving object values from a remote agent, we can set object
values.  For example, we can set the value for the *sysContact* object by 
invoking the `set` method on the context:

```
import org.soulwing.snmp4j.*;

Mib mib = MibFactory.getInstance().newMib();
mib.load("SNMPv2-MIB");

SimpleSnmpV2cTarget target = new SimpleSnmpV2cTarget();
target.setAddress("10.0.0.1");
target.setCommunity("public");

SnmpContext context = SnmpFactory.getInstance().newContext(target, mib);
try {
  Varbind vb = context.newVarbind("sysContact.0", "nobody@nowhere.net");
  VarbindCollection result = context.set(vb).get();
  System.out.println(result.get("sysContact"));
}
finally {
  context.close();
}
```

Notice that when specifying a variable binding to set an object value, we must
use an object *instance* identifier -- in this case we are specifying the
identifier for the singleton instance of the *sysContact* object.

We pass one or more variable bindings to the `set` method.  Each variable 
binding associates a value with an object identifier.  The context has a
factory method that creates `Varbind` objects given an object identifier and
an object value.  The value you pass must be compatible with the data type 
of the associated SNMP object.  

We can also pass a `VarbindCollection` to the `set` method.  This allows you
to fetch a current value for an object, change the value, and update it on the 
remote agent:

```
try {
  VarbindCollection vbs = context.getNext("sysContact").get();
  result.get("sysContact").set("nobody@nowhere.net");
  VarbindCollection result = context.set(vbs).get();
  System.out.println(result.get("sysContact"));
}
finally {
  context.close();
}
```


Retrieving Rows from Conceptual Tables
--------------------------------------

SNMP represents tabular information by allowing a particular object **type** to
have many instances, each identified with a unique subidentifier appended to
the object type's identifier.  For example, in 
[A Brief Diversion on the topic of Object Indexes](#a-brief-diversion-on-the-topic-of-object-indexes)
we learned that the standard MIB's network interface table has perhaps many 
instances of the *ifDescr* object type; one for each network interface managed 
by an agent.

They're called "conceptual" tables, because their representation isn't really
all that tabular.  A table "column" is really just an object type, and because
of the way object instances are identified, all of the columns of a conceptual
table are siblings in the MIB tree, and all of the values of a column are
siblings in a subtree under the column's type object.  The concept of a "row" 
really only arises from the way we specify which objects to retrieve in a 
GET/GETNEXT operation.  

### Table Retrieval Using GETNEXT

Let's start with an example that shows the most primitive (and slowest!) way
to retrieve all of the rows of a table -- using the GETNEXT operation.

```
import org.soulwing.snmp.*;

Mib mib = MibFactory.getInstance().newMib();
mib.load("SNMPv2-MIB");
mib.load("IF-MIB");

SimpleSnmpV2cTarget target = new SimpleSnmpV2cTarget();
target.setAddress("10.0.0.1");
target.setCommunity("public");

SnmpContext context = SnmpFactory.getInstance().newContext(target, mib);
try {
  final String[] columns = {
      "sysUpTime", "ifName", "ifDescr", "ifAdminStatus", "ifOperStatus",
      "ifInOctets", "ifOutOctets"
  };
  VarbindCollection row = context.getNext(columns).get();
  while (row.get("ifName") != null) {
    if (row.size() < columns.length) {
      System.err.println("truncated row; too many objects requested");
      break;
    }
    System.out.format("%14s %-8s %-20s %-4s %-4s %,15d %,15d\n",
        row.get("sysUpTime"),
        row.get("ifName"),
        row.get("ifDescr"),
        row.get("ifAdminStatus"),
        row.get("ifOperStatus"),
        row.get("ifInOctets").asLong(),
        row.get("ifOutOctets").asLong());
    row = context.getNext(row.nextIdentifiers("sysUpTime")).get();
  }
}
finally {
  context.close();
}
```

Assuming you're already familiar with basic SNMP, this example should be fairly
obvious.  We start with a `getNext` using the object **type** identifiers for
some of the columns of the standard MIB's network interface table.  Assuming
that there is at least one network interface managed by the target agent, we'll
enter the *while* loop -- if the result contains an *ifName* object then we 
have a table row.  In the loop body, after we extract and print the column 
values for the current "row", we ask the row object to produce a list of 
object identifiers that will be used to request the next row and then perform
another GETNEXT operation.

This example also illustrates the common practice of including *sysUpTime* in 
the list of object identifiers for each GETNEXT operation.  This provides an
agent-centric time basis for computing rates for counters such as the input and
output octet counters.  Including a singleton object type like *sysUpTime*
means that we can't simply use all of the object identifiers for the current row 
in the request for the next row -- the successor to *sysUpTime.0* is 
*sysContact.0*!  The `nextIdentifiers` method we call on the row object 
(a `VarbindCollection`) provides a handy solution.  We can provide it a list of
the non-repeating (singleton) objects in the collection, and it will produce
a list of object identifiers consisting of the specified non-repeating object
identifiers followed by the identifiers associated with the other (repeating)
objects in the collection.

It's possible to ask for too many objects in a single GETNEXT request.  We
check for that case by comparing the size of the row to the number of objects
we requested.  Requesting too many objects in a single request is a programming 
error, so we simply throw an exception.

### Table Retrieval Using GETBULK

If you ran the previous example to collect the interface table from a real
network device, you probably noticed that it's a bit slow.  Using GETNEXT, we
have to make a full round trip over the network for each entry in the target
SNMP agent's interface table.  You can probably imagine that this approach is not 
going to work very well for a something like an IP route table that could contain
hundreds of thousands of rows.

In SNMPv2, the GETBULK operation was introduced to the protocol to provide a
solution for improving table retrieval performance.  Conceptually, the GETBULK 
operation allows us to perform the *while* loop in the previous example on the 
remote agent itself.  Just like GETNEXT, the GETBULK operation takes a list of 
object identifiers.  As we've seen, when executing the GETNEXT operation, the 
agent returns the successor object instance for each of the specified object
identifiers.  With GETBULK, the agent returns the next *N* successor object 
instances for each of the specified identifiers.

We specify the maximum value for *N* as one of the parameters to the GETNEXT
operation; the protocol specification calls this parameter *max-repetitions*.  The 
value we specify indicates the maximum number of "rows" we want to retrieve in a 
single GETBULK operation.  Of course, the agent may choose to return fewer than
the number of rows we specify.

In our previous example using GETNEXT, we included *sysUpTime* in the request.
Since GETBULK effectively performs *N* GETNEXT operations, we need a way to tell 
it that some of the object identifiers in the request are for non-repeating 
objects.  The GETBULK operation includes a *non-repeating* parameter for this 
purpose -- this parameter is used to indicate that the first *k* identifiers
in the list are for non-repeating object types.

Performing a GETBULK operation with Tnm4j is easy enough:

```
List<VarbindCollection> rows = context.getBulk(1, 10, 
    "sysUpTime", "ifName", "ifInOctets", "ifOutOctets").get();
```

The first parameter to `getBulk` indicates that there is one non-repeating
object type in the list (_sysUpTime_).  The second parameter indicates that we 
want the agent to return as many as 10 rows for the specified columns of the 
interface table.  The remaining parameters identify the object names we wish to
retrieve. The return value from `getBulk` is a list of `VarbindCollection` 
objects.  Based on the parameters specified in this example, the list will 
contain as many as 10 collections -- one per retrieved row.

By now you're probably wondering, *How will I know what to choose as the
maximum number of repetitions?*  In general, there is no way to know the number 
of rows in a conceptual table without actually retrieving it.  So the answer
is that you're going to have to make a guess.  Guessing will have two potential
consequences.  Our guess could be too small, in which case there will be more 
rows in the table that our GETBULK operation did not retrieve -- in this case
we'll want to do one or more subsequent GETBULK operations to complete the
retrieval.  Our guess could be too big, in which case GETBULK might end up 
retrieving objects that aren't part of the table we wanted to retrieve -- in 
this case we'll need to discard the stuff we didn't really want.

Complicating matters even further, the number we choose is just a hint to the
remote agent.  It may choose to return fewer than the number we specified.  Even
worse, the remote agent is allowed to return a partial last row -- i.e. it is 
allowed to truncate the last row if the entire row won't fit neatly into an SNMP 
PDU.

If we take all of these facts into consideration, we can write a table retrieval
loop that uses GETBULK something like this:

```
Mib mib = MibFactory.getInstance().newMib();
mib.load("SNMPv2-MIB");
mib.load("IF-MIB");

SimpleSnmpV2cTarget target = new SimpleSnmpV2cTarget();
target.setAddress("10.0.0.1");
target.setCommunity("public");

SnmpContext context = SnmpFactory.getInstance().newContext(target, mib);
try {
  final int maxRepetitions = 10;

  final String[] columns = {
      "sysUpTime", "ifName", "ifDescr", "ifAdminStatus", "ifOperStatus",
      "ifInOctets", "ifOutOctets"
  };

  List<VarbindCollection> rows =
      context.getBulk(1, maxRepetitions, columns).get();

  outer:
  while (!rows.isEmpty()) {
    VarbindCollection lastRow = null;
    inner:
    for (VarbindCollection row : rows) {

      if (row.get("ifName") == null) break outer;    // doesn't look like ifTable columns

      if (row.size() < columns.length) break inner;  // truncated row... discard it and try again

      lastRow = row;
      System.out.format("%14s %-8s %-20s %-4s %-4s %,15d %,15d\n",
          row.get("sysUpTime"),
          row.get("ifName"),
          row.get("ifDescr"),
          row.get("ifAdminStatus"),
          row.get("ifOperStatus"),
          row.get("ifInOctets").asLong(),
          row.get("ifOutOctets").asLong());
    }
    if (lastRow == null) {
      // if this is the first row, we're asking for too much in a single row
      System.err.println("truncated first row; too many objects requested");
      break outer;
    }
    rows = context.getBulk(1, maxRepetitions,
        lastRow.nextIdentifiers("sysUpTime")).get();
  }
}
finally {
  context.close();
}
```

(You know an algorithm is messy when you find yourself needing labeled *break*
statements!)

In the first couple of lines inside of the try block, we set up for the first
`getBulk` request.  We put the identifiers into an array so we can later use
the array's length to check for a truncated row.  Our array contains *sysUpTime*
so in the call to `getBulk` we indicate that there is one non-repeating object
at the front of the list.

The loop labeled `outer` is going to be used to keep doing `getBulk` calls until
there are no more rows available (or we fall out the loop because we've reached
the end of the table).

The loop labeled `inner` inspects each of the rows to make sure it is still 
actually looking at the table we want (the interface table) and to make sure the
current row hasn't been truncated by the agent.  Assuming the row is good, we
print its contents.  In order to be ready to do the next call to `getBulk` we
need to keep track of the last complete row we processed, so we can use the
identifiers in it as the starting point for the next GETBULK operation -- we
assign the row to *lastRow* for this purpose.

If we fall out of the `inner` loop without having processed at least one full
row, that means we're asking for two many objects in a single request -- we did
something similar in our example using GETNEXT.

At the bottom of the `outer` loop we use the identifiers in the last full row 
for the next call to `getBulk`.  This means that the next GETBULK operation will
pick up right where the last one left off.

### Table Retrieval Using Tnm4j's High-Level Walk Operation

As we saw in the previous section, retrieving a full table using GETBULK is
tricky.  For this reason, Tnm4j includes a high-level `walk` operation that 
uses GETBULK under the covers, but presents an iterator-like interface to your
code.

Here's an example of the same retrieval of the standard interface table we used
in the preceding examples, using Tnm4j's walk operation:

```
Mib mib = MibFactory.getInstance().newMib();
mib.load("SNMPv2-MIB");
mib.load("IF-MIB");

SimpleSnmpV2cTarget target = new SimpleSnmpV2cTarget();
target.setAddress("10.0.0.1");
target.setCommunity("public");

SnmpContext context = SnmpFactory.getInstance().newContext(target, mib);
try {
  SnmpWalker<VarbindCollection> walker = context.walk(1, "sysUpTime", "ifName",
      "ifDescr", "ifAdminStatus", "ifOperStatus", "ifInOctets", "ifOutOctets");
  VarbindCollection row = walker.next().get();
  while (row != null) {
    System.out.format("%14s %-8s %-20s %-4s %-4s %,15d %,15d\n",
        row.get("sysUpTime"),
        row.get("ifName"),
        row.get("ifDescr"),
        row.get("ifAdminStatus"),
        row.get("ifOperStatus"),
        row.get("ifInOctets").asLong(),
        row.get("ifOutOctets").asLong());
    row = walker.next().get();
  }
}
finally {
  context.close();
}
```

As you can see, using `walk` is the easier than using either GETBULK or GETNEXT.
We obtain an `SnmpWalker` object from the context, using the `walk` method with 
a parameter list that is essentially the same as what we used for `getBulk`. The 
walker has a `next` method that executes GETBULK operations with the remote 
agent as needed to retrieve all of the rows from the table.  

While not shown here, the return value from `next` is an `SnmpResponse`
just as it is for any other operation.  We invoke `get` on the return value 
from `next` in order to get the `VarbindCollection` representing the next row.
When `get` returns *null* the walk is complete.  Just as it does for other
operations, `get` will throw an exception if an error occurs in performing the
underlying operations with the SNMP agent.

Because the high-level walk operation is implemented directly on top of Tnm4j's
SNMP provider, it performs better than any table retrieval operation that you 
could write using the `getBulk` operation.  

If you thought writing table retrieval using GETBULK was tricky, imagine writing 
an asynchronous implementation that doesn't block while waiting for the response
to a GETBULK request!  The good news is that you won't have to write that code
yourself, because Tnm4j has done it for you.  Just as it does for all of the
native SNMP operations, Tnm4j provides an asynchronous variant of the high level
walk operation.  This allows you to walk arbitrarily large tables without 
blocking, and allows concurrent retrieval of tables from multiple agents without
requiring a retrieval thread per agent.  See [Asynchronous Operations](#asynchronous-operations)
for details.  

### Accessing Table Index Objects

In SNMP version 2, the management information structure for tables was changed
such that all index objects for tables are specified as *not-accessible*.  Tables
that were defined prior to this change (such as the interface table of the
standard MIB) continue to provide accessible index objects, but all other
tables are subject to this restriction. This restriction makes the agent 
implementation more efficient, but greatly complicates the work of the network
management application.

Table index objects often contain information that is important to network 
management applications.  For example, suppose that our management application 
wants to use the [IPV6-MIB](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2465.txt) to obtain the 
IPv6 addresses that are configured on the interfaces of a network device.  The
`ipv6AddrTable` contains the information that we'd like to retrieve.  If you 
review the definition of this table, you'll note that the most important pieces
of information in this table -- the interface index and the address itself -- 
cannot be retrieved from the table; the ACCESS-TYPE of these objects is 
*not-accessible*.  

Tnm4j makes it easy to access this information (which is encoded in the object
identifiers of the other objects in the table), as shown in the following
example:
  
```
MIB mib = MIBFactory.getInstance().newMib();
mib.load("IPV6-MIB");

SimpleSnmpV2cTarget target = new SimpleSnmpV2cTarget();
target.setAddress("10.0.0.1");
target.setCommunity("public");

SnmpContext context = SnmpFactory.getInstance().newContext(target, mib);
try {
  SnmpWalker<VarbindCollection> walker = context.walk("ipv6AddrPfxLength",
      "ipv6AddrType", "ipv6AddrAnycastFlag", "ipv6AddrStatus");
  VarbindCollection row = walker.next().get();
  while (row != null) {
    System.out.format("%d %s %d %s %s %s\n",
        row.get("ipv6IfIndex").asInt(), row.get("ipv6AddrAddress"),
        row.get("ipv6AddrPfxLength").asInt(), row.get("ipv6AddrType"),
        row.get("ipv6AddrAnycastFlag"), row.get("ipv6AddrStatus"));
    row = walker.next().get();
  }
}
finally {
  context.close();
}
```

When using any of the context's low-level or high-level operation methods, 
the index objects are implicitly available in the resulting `VarbindCollection`, 
even though they were not (and cannot) be among the objects retrieved from the 
table.  Note that this feature requires that you load the relevant MIB(s) and 
provide the resulting `Mib` object to your context object(s). 

The `Varbind.getIndexes` method also provides access to a table object's
indexes.


Asynchronous Operations
-----------------------

Tnm4j fully supports asynchronous SNMP operations.  When using asynchronous
operations, your application does not block while waiting for a response from
an SNMP agent.  Tnm4j's asynchronous operations support can support concurrent
communication with hundreds or even thousands of SNMP agents using just a few
service threads.  

Asynchronous operations are a key ingredient for writing responsive SNMP network 
management applications that scale to support real networks.  Communication with 
SNMP agents can be handled in the background, while application users continue 
to interact with the application's user interface.

> Effective use of asynchronous SNMP operations in Tnm4j requires a solid 
> understanding of Java's facilities supporting concurrency: threads, locks, 
> conditions, and the like.

The `SnmpContext` interface provides `async-` methods for each of the low level
SNMP operations and the high-level walk operation: `asyncGet`, `asyncGetNext`,
`asyncGetBulk`, `asyncSet`, and `asyncWalk`.

### Example: An asynchronous GETNEXT operation.

Let's look at example that uses an asynchronous GETNEXT operation to retrieve
the *sysName* and *sysUpTime* objects from a target SNMP agent.  The setup
looks very similar to our prior examples, with one salient difference:

```
Mib mib = MibFactory.getInstance().newMib();
mib.load("SNMPv2-MIB");

SimpleSnmpV2cTarget target = new SimpleSnmpV2cTarget();
target.setAddress(System.getProperty("tnm4j.agent.address", "10.0.0.1"));
target.setCommunity(System.getProperty("tnm4j.agent.community", "public"));

SnmpContext context = SnmpFactory.getInstance().newContext(target, mib);

SnmpCallback<VarbindCollection> callback = new ExampleCallback();
context.asyncGetNext(callback, "sysName", "sysUpTime");

// go do something else while waiting for the callback
```

When using an asynchronous SNMP operation, we must provide a callback that will
be notified when a response is available from the remote SNMP agent.  In the
example we construct an `ExampleCallback` (that we'll see in just a moment).  We
invoke `asyncGetNext` on the context, passing a reference to our callback and
the list of objects we wish to retrieve.  After we initiate the GETNEXT request 
our application can go on to do some other work -- the callback will be invoked
later (via a different thread) when a response is available.
  
The callback implements the `SnmpCallback<VarbindCollection>` interface.  In our 
example implementation below, we simply print the objects received from the 
remote agent.

```
class ExampleCallback implements SnmpCallback<VarbindCollection> {

  @Override
  public void onSnmpResponse(SnmpEvent<VarbindCollection> event) {
    try {
      VarbindCollection result = event.getResponse().get();
      System.out.format("%s uptime %s\n",
          result.get("sysName"),
          result.get("sysUpTime"));
    }
    catch (SnmpException ex) {
      ex.printStackTrace(System.err);
    }
    finally {
      event.getContext().close();
    }
  }

}
```

When we previously looked at the `get` method in detail, we observed that its
return value is `SnmpResponse<VarbindCallback>` -- when an invoking a 
synchronous SNMP operation, we get an `SnmpResponse` which contains a 
`VarbindCollection` result.  In an asynchronous operation, the callback is
provided an event object that contains an `SnmpResponse` (which in turn
contains a `VarbindCollection`).  The event object also provides a reference
to the same context object that was used to invoke the operation.

As we noted previously, the response object is patterned after the JDK's 
`Future` object.  When we invoke `get` the response object can block until a
response is available.  However, when we invoke `get` on the response object
inside of our callback, it will never block -- the callback is not invoked 
until a response is available.

If a timeout or other error occurs while executing the asynchronous operation,
the call to `get` on the response object will throw an appropriate exception.  
This allows our callback to handle the exception using an ordinary *try* block.

In this example, the context object is closed before the callback returns.  As
we discussed previously, context objects are lightweight, but should be closed
when no longer needed.  In our example, after the callback is finished, we don't 
need the context any more so we close it.  In your design, you might choose to
retain the context for subsequent operations, and that's fine too -- you just 
need to close the context when it really is no longer needed.

If you plop this example into a main method, as is, you'll probably find that
it exits without printing anything.  Because our example doesn't really have 
anything else to do, it terminates before the response is received from the
remote agent.  In a real application, this won't be a problem -- you wouldn't
use asynchronous operations if the application didn't have better things to do
than hang around waiting for a response from the remote SNMP agent. 

To make the example work, you could easily add a `Thread.sleep` after the call 
to `asyncGetNext` to put the main thread to sleep for long enough for a response 
to be received.  This is imprecise, but good enough for this silly example. In 
the example code provided with Tnm4j, the callback is modified so that the 
main method can block until a response is received. 

### Using a Completion Service to Collect Results

Often, in creating network management applications you will write code that 
simply needs to collect and record information from many different SNMP agents.
An `SnmpCompletionService` can be used to simplify this work.  The completion
service provides provides a `submit` method to which you can submit 
`SnmpOperation` object instances for asynchronous execution.  The service has a 
queue like interface that you can use to retrieve `SnmpEvent` objects for 
completed operations, in either a blocking on non-blocking manner.

In addition to the methods such as `getNext` and `asyncGetNext` that directly 
execute SNMP operations, `SnmpContext` provides factory methods that create 
`SnmpOperation` objects.  An operation object provides two overloads of its 
`invoke` method, providing for either synchronous or asynchronous execution.  You 
can create operation objects for operations you wish to perform, and delegate the 
handling of the callback.  `SnmpCompletionService` is designed around this 
concept.

Suppose we wanted to collect *sysName* and *sysUpTime* from many different 
network devices.  Here's an example of how we might accomplish this using a
completion service:

```
Mib mib = MibFactory.getInstance().newMib();
mib.load("SNMPv2-MIB");

SnmpCompletionService<VarbindCollection> completionService =
    new BlockingQueueSnmpCompletionService<VarbindCollection>();

completionService.submit(newOperation("10.0.0.1", "public", mib));
completionService.submit(newOperation("10.0.0.2", "public", mib));
completionService.submit(newOperation("10.0.0.3", "public", mib));

while (!completionService.isIdle()) {
  SnmpEvent<VarbindCollection> event = completionService.take();
  VarbindCollection result = event.getResponse().get();
  System.out.format("%s: sysName=%s sysUpTime=%s\n",
      event.getContext().getTarget().getAddress(),
      result.get("sysName"),
      result.get("sysUpTime"));

  event.getContext().close();
}
```

The basic structure of the main body of our example is quite simple.  We submit
operations on different network devices to the completion service, and then
remain in the loop until all of the results have been obtained.  While the
example simply uses a few hard-coded agent addresses, we could easily imagine
looking those details up in a database and submitting operations to the 
completion service for all of the devices in our network.  

In the loop body, we can see that the `take` method on the completion service 
returns an  `SnmpEvent` object, which we saw in the callback of our previous 
example.  The `take` method blocks until the next event describing a completed 
operation becomes available.  We extract the result from the event and print the 
information requested by the operation.  Since we're done with the context 
associated with the event, we close it. 

The `newOperation` method is shown below.

```
private static SnmpOperation<VarbindCollection> newOperation(String address,
    String community, Mib mib) {
  SimpleSnmpV2cTarget target = new SimpleSnmpV2cTarget();
  target.setAddress(address);
  target.setCommunity(community);

  return SnmpFactory.getInstance().newContext(target, mib)
      .newGetNext("sysName", "sysUpTime");
}
```

As we've seen in previous examples, we create a target that describes the
SNMP agent on which we wish to execute an operation.  When use `SnmpFactory`
to obtain a context for our target, and we use the `newGetNext` factory 
method to obtain an `SnmpOperation` that will perform a GETNEXT for the *sysName* 
and *sysUpTime* objects.

The context interface provides factory methods such as `newGetNext` for all of 
the SNMP operations.  An `SnmpOperation` encapsulates a context, an operation, 
and a list of SNMP objects on which the operation is to be performed.  An 
operation can be invoked either synchronously or asynchronously.  When you 
submit an operation to an `SnmpCompletionService`, the service invokes the 
operation asynchronously, providing a callback that will be used to queue the 
responses, making them available via the public API of the service.
   

Receiving SNMP Notifications (Traps, Informs)
---------------------------------------------

SNMP agents can be configured to send notifications to a management application
when certain events occur.  For example, the standard MIB defines events that 
can notify a management application when a network link managed by an agent 
transitions to an up or down state, or to notify the application when an agent
or the network device it is managing is restarted.  Tnm4j makes it easy to 
respond to notifications received from SNMP agents in some manner that is 
appropriate for your network application. 

SNMP defines two different notification types; TRAP and INFORM.  An INFORM must 
be acknowledged by the recipient, allowing the agent to be assured of its 
delivery.  For the agent, a TRAP is purely fire and forget -- the agent does not 
concern itself with whether a TRAP is actually received by any management 
application.  In Tnm4j, the underlying SNMP provider takes care of acknowledging 
receipt of INFORM events, so the difference between TRAP and INFORM notifications 
is completely transparent to your application.

Tnm4j defines two fundamental objects for handling notifications from SNMP 
agents; *listeners* and *handlers*.

A listener is an instance of `SnmpListener` and is responsible for collaborating
with the underlying SNMP provider to receive and route inbound notifications 
from remote agents to your application.  Listener objects are created by 
`SnmpFactory`.  A listener is configured to listen for notifications addressed 
to a particular port address.  If your application needs to listen on more than 
one port address, you create a listener for each address.

> The default port used by a listener is UDP port 162, which is defined as the
> standard notification port for SNMP.  On most operating systems, this is
> a privileged port and can only be used by processes with superuser access.
> If a `BindException` is thrown when attempting to add a listener, try 
> specifying a port number greater than or equal to 1024 (and less than 65536).

A handler is responsible for doing something useful with a received notification.
Handlers implement the `SnmpNotificationHandler` interface.  This interface 
declares a single `handleNotification` method that receives an event object
that describes a notification and the agent from which it was received.  

Here's an example of the basic setup:

```
Mib mib = MibFactory.getInstance().newMib();
mib.load("SNMPv2-MIB");

SnmpListener listener = SnmpFactory.getInstance().newListener(10162, mib);
try {
  listener.addHandler(new SnmpNotificationHandler() {
    @Override
    public Boolean handleNotification(SnmpNotificationEvent event) {
      System.out.println("received a notification: " + event);
      return true;
    }
  });

  Thread.sleep(60000L);     // wait for some notifications to arrive
}
finally {
  listener.close();         // listeners must be closed when no longer needed
}
```

The notification event object contains an `SnmpNotification` that provides the
details of the received INFORM or TRAP.  The `getType` method can be used to 
determine the notification type.  Legacy SNMPv1 traps are a little 
different than SNMPv2 INFORM and TRAP notifications. When the trap type is 
`TRAPv1`, you may safely cast the notification object to  `SnmpV1Trap` to access 
the additional properties defined for an SNMPv1 trap.

On most Unix hosts, you can use the `snmptrap` and `snmpnotify` commands
(which are part of the Net-SNMP package) to test your notification handler.
For example, the following shell commands can be used to send our example
handler an INFORM, TRAP, and a legacy SNMPv1 TRAP, respectively:

```
snmpinform -v 2c -c public localhost:10162 {} 1.2.3.4 sysUpTime.0 t 218128
snmptrap -v 2c -c public localhost:10162 {} 1.2.3.4 sysUpTime.0 t 218128
snmptrap -v 1 -c public localhost:10162 enterprises.1446 10.0.0.1 0 0 ''
```

See the man pages for these commands for more details on how to use them to send
notifications.

A given listener supports an arbitrary number of handlers and orders them 
according to a priority specified when each handler is registered.  The 
listener-handler interaction is designed around the _strategy pattern_.  When a
notification is received, handlers are notified in priority order.  Each handler 
is allowed to inspect the notification and decide whether to handle it.  The 
first handler that returns `true` is the last handler that will receive the 
notification.  See the javadoc for 
[SnmpListener](http://soulwing.github.io/tnm4j/maven-site/apidocs/org/soulwing/snmp/SnmpListener.html)
for more information.

The strategy-based design allows you to easily write highly cohesive 
notification handlers, each focused on handling a particular kind of 
notification, rather than having a single handler with hard-to-test (and 
hard-to-debug) conditional logic for sorting out what kind of notification was 
received and what do about it.
